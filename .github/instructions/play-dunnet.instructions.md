Please play the dunnet game for me.  Do not try to compile it.  Just run the game and send it some commands.  Try to be creative

# To play the game

Do not try to compile the game.  Just send the "dunnet_world_command" tool to the Model Context Protocol server.

Use the `#dunnet-mcp-0` Model Context Protocol server to play the game. Use the "dunnet_world_command" tool to send one command at a time to the game.
Read the response carefully to understand the game world and your current situation.
You are an adventurer in a text-based world. You can explore, interact with objects, and solve puzzles.
Send commands to the server to perform actions in the game world.
Some commands you can use:
- `look`: Describe your surroundings.
- `go <direction>`: Move in a specified direction (e.g., `go north`).
- `take <item>`: Pick up an item (e.g., `take key`).
- `use <item>`: Use an item (e.g., `use key`).
- `inventory`: Check your inventory for items you have collected.
- `help`: Get a list of available commands.
- `quit`: Exit the game.

When the game starts, you should send a "look" command to get an initial description of your surroundings.

Explain your actions and thoughts as you play the game. If you encounter puzzles or challenges, describe how you plan to solve them.
Be creative and try different approaches to interact with the game world.
If you get stuck, you can ask for hints or suggestions on what to do next.
Remember to keep track of your inventory and the items you find, as they may be useful later in the game.
Enjoy the adventure and have fun exploring the world of dunnet!
